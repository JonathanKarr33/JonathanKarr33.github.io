                <p>I am Jonathan Karr, a rising senior at the <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
                    with a major in <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a
                    concentration in Cyber Security in the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">College
                        of Engineering.</a> I've also explored my intrests are Notre Dame through
                    the minors of <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a> and
                    <a target="_blank"

                    My computer science intrests are in Knowledge Graphs and data analytics. I'm excited to use and
                    continue to develop my skills in order to be a force for good in the world!

        <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
        <p>I am conducting undergraduate research reguarding Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing at Notre Dameâ€™s
        Center for Research Computing. <br><!--I enjoy partaking in this research in order to solve Naval problems. -->
        I enjoy utilizing data analitics through knowledge graphs in order to solve real world problems. <br>
        The rise of AI resources such as ChatGPT has allowed our research to excelerate over the past semester. <br>
        The projects are funded by the Office of Naval Research and service the DoD.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Qualcomm Internships</h3>
        <p>I have enjoyed getting to intern at Qualcomm over the past three summers. <br><br>
        During the summer of 2021, I created a dashboard for the audio team to improve the functionality of the KATS (Kymera Automated Test Systems) framework. <br>
        As a result, the team uses this display on a daily basis. <br>
        This project utilized Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, and Bootstrap. <br>
        <br>
        During the summer of 2022, I created unit tests in C# for QACT (Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool). <br>
        As a result, the team is able to check code functionality easily prior to a new release. <br>
        <br>
        Currently I'm using CMake to create a build system that allows for code to be run across different platforms. <br>
