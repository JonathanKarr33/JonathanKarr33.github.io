                    <p>I am Jonathan Karr, a rising senior at the <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
                        with a major in <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a
                        concentration in Cyber Security in the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">College
                            of Engineering.</a> I've also explored my interests at Notre Dame through
                        minors in <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a> and
                        <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://engineering.nd.edu/departments-programs/undergraduate-programs/minor-in-engineering-corporate-practice/">Engineering
                            Corporate Practice</a>.
                        My computer science interests are in Knowledge Graphs and data analytics. I'm excited to use and
                        continue to develop my skills in order to be a force for good in the world!

            <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
            <p>I am conducting undergraduate research regarding Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing at Notre Dame’s
            Center for Research Computing.<!--I enjoy partaking in this research in order to solve Naval problems. -->
            I enjoy utilizing data analytics through knowledge graphs in order to solve real world problems.
            The rise of AI resources such as ChatGPT has allowed our research to accelerate over the past semester.
            The projects are funded by the Office of Naval Research, and service the DoD.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Qualcomm Internships</h3>
            <p>I have enjoyed getting to intern at Qualcomm over the past three summers.<br><br>
            During the summer of 2021, I created a dashboard for the audio team to improve the functionality of the KATS (Kymera Automated Test Systems) framework.
            As a result, the team uses this display on a daily basis.
            This project utilized Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, and Bootstrap.<br>
            <br>
            During the summer of 2022, I created unit tests in C# for QACT (Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool).
            As a result, the team is able to check code functionality easily prior to a new release.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, I'm using CMake to create a build system that allows for code to be run across different platforms. This allows for a reduced build time while improving efficiency for unit test analysis.<br>

            <h3>The Impact of Teaching</h3>
            <p>I enjoy getting to help others in computer science and all areas of life.
                Whether it is helping a student 1:1 or teaching tens of thousands of students and over 1,000 subscribers through my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSU8477pDHMRo9P-2iSYJQ">YouTube</a> videos, I'm happy to help make a difference however I can.
                I'm grateful that I can use my skills to help others succeed.
            Also, feel free to dive into the <a href="python.html">Python</a> and <a href="c.html">C</a> courses if you would like to get started!
            </p>

            <h3>Robotic Football</h3>
            <p>On the <a target="_blank" href="https://www3.nd.edu/~rfc/">Robotic Football Team</a>, we build robots and compete in a national competition each year.
                As an upperclassman on the code team, I enjoy helping to teach underclassmen how to code the robots in 
                Python. I also have enjoyed being an officer for the past two years!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Student Government: Departments of Technology and Faith</h3>
            <p>For the past two years, I have had an active role in the technology department.
            Last year, I worked to create a wait time tracker for the University Counseling Center which is currently pending approval.
            This year, I'm working to implement a volunteering database.
            On a similar note, I'm excited to create a faith<!--Insert--> database for the Department of Faith!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Running Club</h3>
            <p>I have enjoyed getting to race and lead the team as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://recsports.nd.edu/club-sports/coed-club-sports/coed-running/">Notre Dame Running Club</a>!
            As race coordinator, I expanded our race schedule, started working to create our first ever home meet, created a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNpZdUn29PvfyL_yzhRC0dQ-NzXuiYuxNezb5BCfHpg/edit?usp=sharing">results database</a>,
            and a team <a target="_blank" href="https://notredamerunningclub.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
            I'm excited to help our team continue to grow as the first ever media chair!
            I enjoy being able to run every day, and currently have one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.runeveryday.com/all_active_streaks.php">top 3,000 running streaks in the world</a>, over 1,000 days and counting!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Engineering Leadership Council</h3>
            <p>I enjoy planning events for the engineers at Notre Dame.
                As the fundraising and concession stands chair on the <a target="_blank" href="https://elc.nd.edu/">Engineering Leadership Council</a>, 
                I have loved getting to coordinate sales for my fellow engineers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Alumni Mentoring</h3>
            <p>I’ve enjoyed serving as an alumni mentor for the Notre Dame Prep FIRST Robotics and CyberPatriot teams.
                Through helping high school students on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.killerbees33.com/">Killer Bees Robotics Team</a>, I’ve shown others the impact that coding can have during
            competitions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Stanford Hall</h3>
            <p>I am proud to call <a target="_blank" href="https://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/">Stanford Hall</a> home! It is great to welcome freshmen and share in a great dorm culture!
                I enjoy helping make the hall a better place and by welcoming people to Mass as Stanford Hall Sacristan and Greeter!
