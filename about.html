                <h3>Graduate Research</h3>
                <p>As part of the Lucy Institute for Data & Society, I'm conducting research on NLP bias detection regarding homelessness in South Bend. 
                We are comparing online textual biases against people experiencing homelessness (PEH) with data from cities across the United States. The dataset includes small cities such as South Bend as well as larger cities such as San Francisco.
                We created a lexicon of words related to PEH and are collecting data from social media (Reddit and X), newspapers, and meeting minutes.</p>
                <p>Our research proposal paper has been accepted to IJCAI'25 and can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390799146_What_is_Behind_Homelessness_Bias_Using_LLMs_and_NLP_to_Mitigate_Homelessness_by_Acting_on_Social_Stigma">here</a>.
                We also have another paper with results that is currently under review.
                You can also read a university article detailing the project's plan within the Strategic Framework Grant <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nd.edu/stories/using-artificial-intelligence-to-change-minds/">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I am advised by Dr. Nitesh Chawla, and the project PIs are Dr. Georgina Curto Rex and Dr. Matthew Hauenstein.</p>

                <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
                <p>I conducted undergraduate research regarding Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing at Notre Dame's
                Center for Research Computing. We created a Knowledge Extraction pipeline and evaluated 16 trusted, local NLP tools on FAA data. Our OMIN (Operation Maintenance Intelligence) dataset can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13333825">here</a>. 
                Our research article is currently pending publication. 
                The projects are funded by the Office of Naval Research and service the DoD.</p>

                <p>I have enjoyed getting to intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> over the past three summers.</p>
                <h4>Summer of 2021</h4>
                <p>I created a dashboard for the audio team to improve the functionality of the KATS (Kymera Automated Test Systems) framework.
                As a result, the team uses this display on a daily basis.
                This project utilized Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, and Bootstrap.</p>
                
                <h4>Summer of 2022</h4>
                <p>I created unit tests in C# for <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qact-platform">QACT (Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool)</a>.
                As a result, the team is able to check code functionality easily prior to a new release.</p>
                
                <h4>Summer of 2023</h4>
                <p>I transitioned the team's build system to CMake. This allows the code to be run across different platforms, reducing build time while improving efficiency for unit test analysis.</p>
