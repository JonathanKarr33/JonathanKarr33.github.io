                    <p>I am Jonathan Karr, a first year <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.nd.edu/departments-programs/graduate-programs/phd-in-computer-science-and-engineering/"> Computer Science Ph.D. student </a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>.
                        My current research focuses on bias detection and mitigation in large language models, with a particular emphasis on topics related to homelessness and faith. My broader research interests include data mining, LLMs, and graph learning. 
                        In May of 2024 I completed my undergrad at Notre Dame with a major in <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a concentration in Cyber Security in the <a
                            target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">College of Engineering.</a> I've also explored my interests at Notre Dame through 
                            minors in <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a> and

            <h3>Graduate Research</h3>
            As part of the Lucy Institue for Data & Society, I conducting research on NLP bias deterction reguarding homelessness in Southbend. 
            We are creating a taxonomy based on social media, newspapers, and meeting minutes. We will compare the results amoung other similar cities.
            A university article on the research proposal can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nd.edu/stories/using-artificial-intelligence-to-change-minds/">here</a>.
            I am advised by Dr. Nitesh Chawla, and the project PIs are Dr. Georgina Curto Rex and Dr. Matthew Hauenstein.
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
            <p>I conducted undergraduate research regarding Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing at Notre Dameâ€™s
            Center for Research Computing. We created a Knowledge Extraction pipeline and evaluated 16 trusted, local NLP tools FAA data. Our OMIN (Operation Maintenance Intelligence) dataset can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13333825">here</a>. 
            Our research article is currently pending publication. 
            The projects are funded by the Office of Naval Research, and service the DoD.</p>

            <h3>Qualcomm Internships</h3>
            <p>I have enjoyed getting to intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> over the past three summers.<br><br>
            <u>Summer of 2021</u> -  I created a dashboard for the audio team to improve the functionality of the KATS (Kymera Automated Test Systems) framework.
            As a result, the team uses this display on a daily basis.
            This project utilized Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, and Bootstrap.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Summer of 2022</u> - I created unit tests in C# for <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qact-platform">QACT (Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool)</a>.
            As a result, the team is able to check code functionality easily prior to a new release.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Summer of 2023</u> - I transitioned the team's build system CMake. As a result, this allows the code to be run across different platforms. This reduced the build time while improving efficiency for unit test analysis.<br>
