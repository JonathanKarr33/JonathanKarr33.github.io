                <p>I am Jonathan Karr, a rising senior at the <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
                    with a major in <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a
                    concentration in Cyber Security in the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">College
                        of Engineering.</a> I've also explored my interests are Notre Dame through
                    minors in <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a> and

                    My computer science interests are in Knowledge Graphs and data analytics. I'm excited to use and
                    continue to develop my skills in order to be a force for good in the world!

        <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
        <p>I am conducting undergraduate research regarding Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing at Notre Dameâ€™s
        Center for Research Computing.<br><!--I enjoy partaking in this research in order to solve Naval problems. -->
        I enjoy utilizing data analytics through knowledge graphs in order to solve real world problems.<br>
        The rise of AI resources such as ChatGPT has allowed our research to accelerate over the past semester.<br>
        The projects are funded by the Office of Naval Research, and service the DoD.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Qualcomm Internships</h3>
        <p>I have enjoyed getting to intern at Qualcomm over the past three summers.<br><br>
        During the summer of 2021, I created a dashboard for the audio team to improve the functionality of the KATS (Kymera Automated Test Systems) framework.<br>
        As a result, the team uses this display on a daily basis.<br>
        This project utilized Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, and Bootstrap.<br>
        <br>
        During the summer of 2022, I created unit tests in C# for QACT (Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool).<br>
        As a result, the team is able to check code functionality easily prior to a new release.<br>
        <br>
        Currently, I'm using CMake to create a build system that allows for code to be run across different platforms.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Impact of Teaching</h3>
        <p>I enjoy getting to help others in computer science and all areas of life.<br>
            Whether it is helping a student 1:1 or teaching tens of thousands of students and over 1,000 subscribers through my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSU8477pDHMRo9P-2iSYJQ">YouTube</a> videos, I'm happy to help make a difference however I can.<br>
            I'm grateful that I can use my skills to help others succeed.<br>
        Also, feel free to dive into the <a href="python.html">Python</a> and <a href="c.html">C</a> courses if you would like to get started!

        <p>On the <a target="_blank" href="https://www3.nd.edu/~rfc/">Robotic Football Team</a>, we build robots and compete in a national competition each year.<br>
            As an upperclassman on the code team, I enjoy helping to teach underclassmen how to code the robots in 
            Python.<br>I also have enjoyed being an officer for the past two years!</p>

        <h3>Student Government: Departments of Technology and Faith</h3>
        <p>For the past two years, I have had an active role in the technology department.<br>
        Last year, I worked to create a wait time tracker for the University Counseling Center which is currently pending approval.<br>
        This year, I'm working to implement a volunteering database.<br>
        On a similar note, I'm excited to create a faith<!--Insert--> database for the Department of Faith!
