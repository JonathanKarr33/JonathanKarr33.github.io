<p>I am Jonathan Karr, a rising second year <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.nd.edu/departments-programs/graduate-programs/phd-in-computer-science-and-engineering/">Computer Science Ph.D. student</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>.
    I am also a concurrent first-year MA student in <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a>.
    My current research focuses on bias detection and mitigation in large language models, with a particular emphasis on topics related to homelessness and faith. My broader research interests include data mining, LLMs, and graph learning. 
    In May of 2024, I completed my undergraduate studies at Notre Dame with a major in <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a concentration in Cyber Security in the <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.nd.edu/">College of Engineering</a>. I've also explored my interests through 
    minors in <a target="_blank" href="https://theology.nd.edu/">Theology</a> and 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.nd.edu/departments-programs/undergraduate-programs/minor-in-engineering-corporate-practice/">Engineering Corporate Practice</a>. 
    I'm excited to use and continue to develop my skills to be a force for good in the world!</p>
